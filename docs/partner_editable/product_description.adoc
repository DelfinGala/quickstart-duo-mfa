Signing in to the AWS Management Console traditionally requires a user name and password. To help mitigate the threat of leaked credentials, AWS offers the ability to enable MFA for your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or your root credentials.

If you’re using a federation mechanism, such as AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) with an AWS Directory Service option, you must configure your own MFA implementation. One common approach is to use an MFA provider, such as Duo. In this scenario, you log in to the AWS Management Console using your Active Directory credentials. You then use the https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile[Duo Mobile app] with one of Duo's supported authentication methods, and your Active Directory credentials to authenticate you to AWS.

For a primer on configuring MFA manually using your on-premises RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) implementation, see the blog post https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-multi-factor-authentication-for-amazon-workspaces-and-amazon-quicksight-by-using-microsoft-ad-and-on-premises-credentials/[How to Enable Multi-Factor Authentication for AWS Services by Using AWS Microsoft AD and On-Premises Credentials].

If you don’t have a current RADIUS implementation, you can use this Quick Start to automate the process of provisioning a RADIUS infrastructure in AWS using the https://duo.com/docs/authproxy-reference[Duo Authentication Proxy] as the MFA provider. This provides an additional layer of security for accessing your critical resources integrated with AWS Directory Service.
