* Federal accounts: https://admin.duofederal.com[https://admin.duofederal.com^]
. Navigate to *Applications*.
. Obtain the integration key, secret key, and API hostname. You will enter these three items as template parameter values when you deploy this Quick Start. 
* If directory synchronization is not required, do the following:
.. Choose *Protect an Application*.
.. In the applications list, locate the entry for *Auth API*. On the far right, choose *Protect*.
.. Configure the application, and get your integration key, secret key, and API hostname. Write down these three items. For details, see https://duo.com/docs/protecting-applications[Protecting Applications^]. 
* If directory synchronization is required, do the following:
.. Set up directory sync by following the steps in https://duo.com/docs/adsync[Synchronizing Users from Active Directory^].
.. From the Duo administrator panel, choose *Users*. Then choose *Directory Sync*, *New Directory*, *On-Premises Active Directory* (even if Amazon Managed AD).
.. Enter a directory name (needed to identify the directory in Duo), the host IPs, and the port. (You will enter the other IP and port for the second DC later).
.. For *Authentication Type*, choose *NTLMv2*.
.. Enter the base DN, following the instructions.
.. If needed, change other settings.
.. Choose *Add Directory.*
.. After the screen refreshes, scroll to the bottom, where the integration key, secret key, and API hostname appear. Write down these three items.
//TODO Dave, Are these steps still accurate as I've revised them?
//TODO Dave, How will people know if directory synchronization is required? (What gets synchronized with what?)
