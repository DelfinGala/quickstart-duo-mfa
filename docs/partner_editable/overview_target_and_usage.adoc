This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for those who intend to use AWS Directory Service directory types—such as https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/[AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory^] (also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD) and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_ad_connector.html[Active Directory Connector^] (AD Connector)—and who want to apply https://duo.com/product/multi-factor-authentication-mfa[multi-factor authentication (MFA) from Duo^].

This Quick Start deploys Duo using the https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/[AWS Fargate^] serverless compute engine for containers. With this Quick Start, you can build an environment that's ready for compliance with https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/[Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)^]. Since CMMC certification is typically required of U.S. Department of Defense contractors, this Quick Start supports Duo Federal Edition.
