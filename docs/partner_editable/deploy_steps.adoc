=== Launch the Quick Start
// Adapt the following warning to your Quick Start.
WARNING: If you’re deploying {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC, make sure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances and that the subnets aren’t shared. This Quick Start doesn’t support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet. Also make sure that the domain name option in the DHCP options is configured as explained in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^]. You provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

NOTE: You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using this Quick Start. For full details, see the pricing pages for each AWS service used by this Quick Start. Prices are subject to change.

Each deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete.

[start=2]
. Check the AWS Region that’s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This Region is where the network infrastructure for {partner-product-short-name} is built. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default.

// *Note:* This deployment includes Amazon EFS, which isn’t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/elasticfilesystem.html[endpoints and quotas webpage].
[start=3]
// . Update Directory Controller Security Group

//     * Ensure the existing security group associated with your domain controllers allow User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 1812 (by default or specify the port) egress (Outbound) to their own subnet CIDR range (or the entire VPC).

// . Upload Duo Zip File to S3

//     * Either create a new S3 bucket or use an existing CloudFormation template bucket.
//     * Unzip the delivered Duo zip file, and upload the quickstart-duo-mfa folder to the S3 bucket.
//     * Make note of the S3 bucket name and folder prefix, this will be used in the parameters of the CloudFormation template below.


. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. For details on each parameter, see the link:#_parameter_reference[Parameter reference] section of this guide. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.
. After you successfully launch the stack, follow these steps as the ECS containers are starting up:
.. Validate that the ECS Service starts up the number of instances that you specified in the parameters (default of two).
.. Navigate to the Amazon ECS console, and look for *ECS Cluster* under which you will see the *ECS service*. Under the service you should see 2 tasks and they should have a status of *Pending* or *Running*.

[start=3]
.. Click on one of the tasks and open the container tab to see the logs in CloudWatch. You can either click on the top tab or under the container tab to see the CloudWatch logs as shown in <<ecs_task_cloudwatch_logs>>.
.. Navigate to the Directory Service console, and select your directory.
.. Choose the *Networking & security* tab.
.. In the *Multi-factor authentication* pane at the bottom of the page, the RADIUS status should be *Completed* (it can take a few minutes for Systems Manager to register and configure the instances). If the status is *Failed*, see Troubleshooting MFA implementation, later in this guide. To view the MFA configuration, choose the *Actions* dropdown option in the *Multi-factor authentication* pane, and then choose *Edit*. You will see the IP addresses of the RADIUS instances created by the Auto Scaling group. The shared secret code values are empty for security reasons.
.. Open the Amazon WorkSpaces Client.
.. When it opens, ensure you are using the Registration code from your Registered ADC that you used for the Duo setup above. 
.. Once it loads to the screen to input your username and password, you should see a third text box for the MFA Code. Here you will need to enter the code from the mobile app, or the hardware security token mentioned prior.

[start=6]
. Sync Users to Duo Cloud and add hardware token (optional). This step is only valid if Directory sync was chosen, otherwise this step can be ignored.
.. Once you have validated that everything is working, go back to the Duo Admin site.
.. Either go back to the screen you left open for Add New Directory or click on *Users* on the left hand side of screen, then click on *Directory Sync* near the top right.
.. You will need to input the NTLM domain (the Active Directory domain).
.. You will need to input the NTLM workstation (the hostname of one of the Duo Radius ECS ip addresses) (example: 10.0.10.10, 10.0.11.10).
.. Click *refresh* at the bottom of the page, this should bring you to the top of the page which will instruct to select a group to import.
.. At the bottom of the page, select the *Groups* input field, and type out the AD group with the users you want to have imported into Duo. 
.. Click *Save Groups*.
.. At the top of the page, you should now be able to select *Sync Now*.
.. Now that you have users synced, click on the *Users* link on the left side of the screen.
.. You should now see the list of users that were imported from your AD Group.
.. If you click on a user, you will see details about the user that were imported from AD as well as additional Duo-specific details. You are able to change the user toggle the user status between Active and Bypass to determine whether they require MFA for login.
.. You can add a user's phone number to allow them to use the Duo Mobile application, and you can add a Hardware Tokens. 
... To add a hardware token, click on the *Add Hardware Token* button.
... On the Attach Hardware Token screen, you can start to type the serial number of one of the tokens that you ordered and then click on *Attach Hardware Token*.

=== Modifying the implementation

If you want to increase or decrease the number of RADIUS tasks after implementing the solution, update the CloudFormation stack and specify the desired number of servers. 
If you increase the number of tasks, the ECS Service starts up the number of new tasks and installs and configures the Duo Authentication Proxy for each new task. 

:xrefstyle: short
[#duo_ecs_service_stable]
.ECS service stable
image::../images/duo_ecs_service_stable.png[Architecture,width=75%,height=75%]

After each task is configured, the ECS service triggers an event notifying that the service has reached a steady state as shown in <<duo_ecs_service_stable>>.
 
That CloudWatch event triggers a Lambda function that finds the IP address of the Fargate task and updates the SSM parameter *DuoServiceIps*, which triggers another event that updates the Directory Service MFA. The whole process takes 2-3 minutes.
 
Application Autoscaling in the ECS service automatically scales the ECS tasks when CPU or memory limits are reached. This allows for handling spikes in traffic, such as early morning logins. Likewise, when the ECS service does not see much activity Application Autoscaling decreases the number of tasks, and then triggers the preceding workflow to get IP addresses from Lambda functions and update the Directory Service RADIUS configuration.

It is recommended to stand up a regular trigger on a pipeline to get the latest code and build it. By default, the trigger frequency is set to weekly, which can be changed with a CloudFormation parameter during stack creation or update. When the secrets are rotated the newest image is automatically pulled and deployed. ECR is configured to scan on push and builds can wait to see the results of the scan. If the build or scan fails then Duo administrators are notified.
